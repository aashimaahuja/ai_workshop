Response will confirm success or failure.

# Payment API Documentation

## Overview

The Payment API provides a secure interface for initiating and processing
customer transactions.

## Authentication

All requests must include a valid Bearer token in the Authorization header.
Example: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

## Endpoint: Create Payment

`POST /payments`

### Request Body

```json
{
  "amount": 100.0,
  "currency": "USD",
  "payment_method": "card"
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "transaction_id": "txn_12345",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-25T14:30:00Z"
}
```

### Error Handling

- **400 Bad Request** ‚Äì invalid parameters
- **401 Unauthorized** ‚Äì missing or invalid token
- **500 Internal Server Error** ‚Äì unexpected failure

### Best Practices

- Always retry on 500 with exponential backoff.
- Log transaction IDs for reconciliation.
- Use HTTPS exclusively for all requests.
