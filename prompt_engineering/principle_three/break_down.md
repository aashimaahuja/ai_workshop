# Break Down Complex Tasks

Instead of asking AI to do a big task all at once, split it into smaller subtasks. Each subtask has its own deliverable and can be solved step by step.

## 🔹 Example: User Login Functionality

### ❌ Vague Prompt

"Build user login."

**➡️ Problem:** Too broad, unclear what steps are needed.

### ✅ Broken-Down Prompt

"Break down 'User Login' into subtasks. Show each step with deliverable and test criteria."

- Decide auth method Session Vs JWT
- Create user model
- Build login API (/auth/login endpoint)
- Add validation
- UI form

## Key Takeaway

**Big request** → vague, risky output.

**Small subtasks** → clear, structured, testable outputs.

**Works like breaking a project into user stories in real life.**
