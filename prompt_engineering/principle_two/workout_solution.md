# Work it out before answering

"Work it out before answering" = tell the model to workout its own solution before answering. You're encouraging careful reasoning (not a gut response) while asking for concise output.

## Example: Bat & ball

### Problem

```
A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total.
The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball.
How much does the ball cost?
```

### ❌ If you just ask quickly

"What's the answer?"

**(Common rushed answer: $0.10 — wrong.)**

### ✅ If you ask it to think first

```
Work it out privately before answering
Think through the problem step by step before giving the final answer.
```

## Key Takeaway

**Without guidance** → AI guesses too fast.

**With guidance** → AI "takes a moment to solve it" before answering.

**Use simple words:** "Don't rush, think it through first."
