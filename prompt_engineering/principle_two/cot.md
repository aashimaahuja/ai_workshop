# Chain of Thought (COT)

Chain of Thought (COT) is when you ask AI to solve a problem step by step instead of jumping straight to the final answer.

It's like when we write down the steps of our thinking before giving the solution ‚Äî this helps the AI produce clearer, more accurate results.

## Example: Posting Meeting Summary in Dutch to Slack

### Without COT (vague prompt)

"Post the following meeting notes in Dutch in the #eng-team Slack channel."

**‚û°Ô∏è Output might be messy:** too long, wrong formatting, English left mixed in.

### With COT (explicit steps)

```
You are an assistant helping with internal communication.

**Task:** Post the following meeting notes into the #eng-team Slack channel in Dutch.

**Follow these steps:**

1. Generate a short summary of the meeting in English (3‚Äì5 points).
2. Translate the summary into Dutch.
3. Format it for Slack:
   - Title in bold: "üìå Vergadersamenvatting"
   - Bullet points for each item
4. Check the message is fully in Dutch and Slack-friendly.
5. Return only the final formatted Slack message.
```

**Without COT** ‚Üí AI might skip steps and make mistakes.

**With COT** ‚Üí AI delivers exactly what you want: concise, translated, formatted, Slack-ready.

Reasoning models already ‚Äúthink in steps,‚Äù but making the steps explicit helps control quality and style of the output.
